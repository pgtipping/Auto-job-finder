# Auto Job Finder

First, configure your OpenAI API key. Then upload your PDF resume to the auto_job_find folder and name it "my_cover". After that, execute write_response.py.
This will automatically create an OpenAI assistant and generate a .json file locally. This file is only created the first time you run it. On subsequent runs, if this json file is detected, it will use the existing assistant.
